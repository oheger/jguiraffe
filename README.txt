This is the main repository of the JGUIraffe project.

JGUIraffe is a framework supporting the implementation of Java desktop
applications using concepts like declarative UI definition, action and
command objects, and dependency injection.

From version 1.3 on, JGUIraffe uses GIT as version control system. You can
find the most recent code base here. Older versions have been managed with
Subversion.
