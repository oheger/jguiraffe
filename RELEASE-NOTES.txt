INTRODUCTION
============

This document contains the release notes for this version of the JGUIraffe
library. JGUIraffe is a framework supporting the implementation of Java
desktop applications using concepts like declarative UI definition, action and
command objects, and dependency injection.

The 1.2 release stands under a single topic: OSGi support. The jar file is now
an OSGi bundle, many classes have been updated to work properly in an OSGi
environment, and a new chapter dealing with JGUIraffe and OSGi has been added
to the user's guide.

Below is the full list of fixed tracker issues:
