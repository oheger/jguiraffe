                           JGUIraffe Library
                               Version 1.3
                              Release Notes


INTRODUCTION
============

This document contains the release notes for this version of the JGUIraffe
library. JGUIraffe is a framework supporting the implementation of Java
desktop applications using concepts like declarative UI definition, action and
command objects, and dependency injection.

The most striking feature in version 1.3 is support for JavaFX as an additional
platform supported by the library. This means that UI declarations processed by
JGUIraffe can be transformed into JavaFX applications in the same way as this
was supported formerly for Swing.

In order to achieve this and increase modularity, code specific to a target UI
platform was refactored out of the main jar artifact. There is now a core jar
with basic functionality of the JGUIraffe framework and several jars for
specific target platforms (currently Swing and JavaFX). When you update from
version 1.2 make sure that you add the correct platform-specific jar to the
classpath. (This is described in more detail in the new chapter "Project setup"
of the user's guide.)

Provided that both the core jar and a platform-specific jar are present in the
classpath, version 1.3 is binary compatible with version 1.2. The clirr report
shows some errors, but these are all caused by Swing-related classes moved to
the jar for the Swing platform. So an upgrade should be possible without
affecting a client application.

In addition to the main topic - JavaFX support -, some smaller fixes and
improvements have been implemented. A complete list of changes is provided
below:

NEW FEATURES
============
* [http://sourceforge.net/p/jguiraffe/feature-requests/7]
  JavaFX is now supported as target platform.

* [http://sourceforge.net/p/jguiraffe/feature-requests/6]
  Added the tag di:resource to resolve resources on the class path.

BUG FIXES
=========
* [http://sourceforge.net/p/jguiraffe/bugs/9]
  The default value of the canShrink property of PercentLayoutBase was
  changed from false to true. This is appropriate for the majority of
  use cases.

* [http://sourceforge.net/p/jguiraffe/bugs/8]
  SwingMessageOutput no longer allows HTML-based formatting. Leading and
  trailing html tags are removed from the message text.

* [http://sourceforge.net/p/jguiraffe/bugs/7]
  SwingMessageOutput now allows specifying a maximum line length.
  Message texts are processed so that no line exceeds the specified
  length. Line wrapping is enabled per default.

* [http://sourceforge.net/p/jguiraffe/bugs/6]
  The documentation of the MessageOutput interface was improved regarding
  the way the passed in message text is processed.

* [http://sourceforge.net/p/jguiraffe/bugs/5]
  The colrenderer tag now works as expected in Swing.

* [http://sourceforge.net/p/jguiraffe/bugs/4]
  Editable tree view components now work correctly in Swing.

* [http://sourceforge.net/p/jguiraffe/bugs/3]
  Editable combo boxes no longer throw an exception in Swing.

OTHER CHANGES
=============
* Colors now support a logic representation. This is useful for instance
  when dealing with style sheets. The serialization format and the
  string representation of class Color have changed.

* The dependency to Commons BeanUtils has been updated to version 1.9.2.
  (The older versions 1.8.3 still works.)

* The dependency to Commons Configuration has been updated to version 1.10.
  (The older versions 1.8 or 1.9 still work.)
