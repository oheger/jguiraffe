In this package the main application class can be found.
</p>
<p>
<code>Application</code> is the start up class of this framework. An instance
initializes all required helper classes and constructs the GUI. It also controls
the command dispatch thread.
</p>
<p>
The <code>Application</code> class is fully functional; it can be directly used.
If customization is required (e.g. if some of the helper classes are to be
replaced) or if command line arguments need to be processed, a custom
application class can be derived from this class.
</p>
<p>
In addition to the central <code>Application</code> class this package contains
other classes directly related to <code>Application</code>. There is the
<code>ApplicationContext</code> interface which provides access to many helper
objects managed by an application. There are also some helper classes that can
be used by typical applications, e.g. often required commands or action tasks.
