<p>
A package with tag handler classes for creating GUI components.
</p>
<p>
The most classes in this package are Jelly tag handler classes that are
responsible for the creation of GUI components. The base class
<code>FormBaseTag</code> spans a hierarchy that is divided in pure graphical
components (derived from <code>SimpleComponentTag</code>) and components that
gather user input (derived from <code>InputComponentTag</code>).
</p>
<p>
These tags do not create the corresponding input components themselves; they
rather represent a <em>description</em> of components. A concrete implementation
of the <code>ComponentManager</code> interface (defined in the parent package)
knows how to create real widgets from such a description.
