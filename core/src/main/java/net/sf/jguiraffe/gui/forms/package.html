A package for dealing with forms.
</p>
<p>
In typical GUI applications forms are used for gathering data from the user.
Creating a form is usually a tedious task. In addition to the presentation of
the data the developer has to deal with more or less complex logic, including
<ul>
<li>initializing the form's input fields from the model,</li>
<li>handling the OK and the Cancel button correctly,</li>
<li>performing validation of user input,</li>
<li>optionally mark input fields that contain no valid data,</li>
<li>transfer the data entered by the user back into the application's model.</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
This package provides fundamental classes and interfaces for addressing such
common problems. Its main goal is making the handling of forms as easy as
possible. 
</p>
<p>
The main class of this package is the <code>Form</code> class. A <code>Form</code>
object is a representation of a GUI form including all its input fields.
Using methods provided by this class, it is possible to copy data between the
input fields and the data model in both directions. Support for validation on
both the field level and the form level (which allows for semantical checks
involving the form as a whole) is available, too.
