<h2><a name="Intro"></a>Intro</h2>
      
<p>
        Developing sophisticated and responsive user interfaces in Java is
        complicated. Because of Java's concept of <i>LayoutManagers</i> you
        cannot simply place components at fixed coordinates, you rather have to
        deal with nested containers and layout constraints. This abstract way
        of describing a user interface renders visual editors only limited
        helpful.
      </p>
      
<p>
        If your application has to perform non trivial tasks in response of a
        user action, you will sooner or later have to deal with worker threads
        to keep the user interface responsive - unless your users are known to
        be very patient.
      </p>
      
<p>
        Another non trivial requirement of modern applications and especially
        of rich clients for internet applications is the ability to present the
        user interface in the language of the logged in user. Though Java provides
        wide support for internationalization and localization writing the required
        boiler plate code to make an application multi-lingual is not always
        fun.
      </p>
      
<p>
        The afore mentioned problems (and many more) are typical in the field of
        GUI design. The aim of the <i>JGuiraffe</i> library is to provide
        solutions for some common problems a developer faces again and again, e.g.
        constructing user interfaces, working with layout managers, dealing with
        dialogs and form beans, and more. This is of course not the ultimate tool
        you simply need to ask &quot;do it for me&quot; and it automatically does what you
        want (and after everything is completed serves you a nice cup of java).
        But it should provide some features which make a developer's life easier
        and allow him or her to concentrate on the business logic of the
        application to be created.
      </p>

<h3><a name="Features"></a>Features</h3>
      
<p>
        The following list contains an overview of the topics addressed by the
        <i>JGuiraffe</i> library:
        </p>
<ul>
          
<li>Provides some powerful layout managers which can be used to build
          complicated layouts.</li>
          
<li>Allows to define user interfaces in XML files thus supporting a
          clean separation between design and logic.</li>
          
<li>Supports an easy, but powerful way of dealing with input forms.
          The user's input can be automatically validated and - if validation
          was successfull - filled into a data object.</li>
          
<li>Basic support for different kinds of resource bundles to load
          internationalized messages or labels for GUI controls.</li>
          
<li>An implementation of the <i>Command</i> pattern that allows to
          execute code in reaction of a user action in a worker thread.</li>
        </ul>
      
      
<p>
        One main approach followed by this library is to extract as much
        information as possible from the Java code and to provide it in a
        declarative form. So it should be possible to alter the behavior of
        your application by simple modifying some configuration files.
