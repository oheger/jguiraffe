<h2><a name="The_tutorial_application"></a>The tutorial application</h2>
  
<p>
    In the source code repository, next to the code of the actual library, there
    is a module with sample code. It is named <i>examples</i>. The major part
    of this module consists of an example application demonstrating many of the
    features offered by the <i>JGUIraffe</i> library. This section describes
    the tutorial application. It is intended to be an extension of the
    <a href="userguide/user_guide.html">user's guide</a>. While the user's guide
    provides a whole lot of background information, this document is more
    focused on practical things. It can also be used to get a quick jump start
    into development with the <i>JGUIraffe</i> library.
  </p>

  <section>
<h3><a name="Features_of_the_tutorial_application"></a>Features of the tutorial application</h3>
  
<p>
    The tutorial application is not designed to be used as a productive tool.
    Rather, its goal is to demonstrate typical programming practices working well
    with the <i>JGUIraffe</i> library. This manifests itself in the fact that
    many features - especially &quot;dangerous&quot; operations like removing
    files - have not been implemented. As problem domain a file system browser
    application was chosen. The following screenshot shows the main window of
    the application:
  </p>
  <img src="images/tutorial_main.png" alt="Main window of the tutorial application" />
  
<p>
    The application follows typical UI conventions of directory browsing tools.
    The main panel (below the menu and the tool bar) is split into two areas.
    On the left hand site there is a combo box allowing the user to select a
    root file system. On Windows systems it contains the drive letters
    available. Below the combo box there is a tree view component displaying
    the directory structure of the file system currently selected. On the right
    hand site there is a table showing the content (the sub directories and
    files) of the directory selected in the tree view on the left.
  </p>
  
<p>
    From the tool bar or the main menu some operations can be triggered to do
    something with the file(s) selected. The availability of these operations
    depends on the current selection. For instance, a group of actions is active
    only if a single file is selected. When selecting the <i>View settings...</i>
    menu item from the <i>Extras</i> menu a dialog window pops up allowing the
    definition of view-related properties for the current directory:
  </p>
  <img src="images/tutorial_viewsettings.png" alt="Dialog window with view settings" />
  
<p>
    Using this dialog window many details of the display of the current directory
    can be specified, for instance colors, the sorting of the files and sub
    directories, and filter conditions. The settings entered in this dialog
    window are saved in a file in the directory so that they can be applied
    whenever the user navigates to this directory.
  </p>
  
<p>
    An action <i>File new</i> available from both the main menu and the tool
    bar allows the creation of a new file. It displays a dialog window in which
    the user can enter a file name and text content of the file. Closing this
    window with the OK button creates such a file in the current directory. This
    dialog window and the builder script which defines it is also subject of the
    chapter <a href="userguide/builderscript.html">A complete builder script</a>
    of the user's guide.
  </p>
  
<p>
    There is another action which demonstrates dealing with long-running
    operations: If <i>Extras / Long operation</i> is selected, a dialog window
    appears which allows the configuration of a dummy background task - mainly
    the duration of the task in seconds can be entered using a slider control.
    When the dialog window is closed the task runs in the background (it does
    nothing useful), and another window is displayed showing the progress of the
    task.
  </p>
  
<p>
    How dialogs for selecting files are displayed is demonstrated by the
    <i>Extras / Select and open file</i> action. The action displays a
    standard file chooser dialog. When the user selects a file, it is opened in
    the application registered for this file type.
  </p>

<h3><a name="Quick_start"></a>Quick start</h3>
  
<p>
    A <i>JGUIraffe</i> application requires a minimum set of files in order to
    successfully launch it and to configure the framework. Of course, these
    files are present for the tutorial application, too. We provide an overview
    over these files here. This is especially useful for the impatient readers,
    so they can start with their own experiments.
  </p>
  
<p>
    Each Java application needs a startup class, i.e. a class containing a
    <code>main()</code> method. A <i>JGUIraffe</i> application does not
    strictly require a custom startup class because the
    <code><a href="apidocs/net/sf/jguiraffe/gui/app/Application.html">
    Application</a></code> class comes with a <code>main()</code> method which can
    be used out of the box. However, providing an application-specific startup
    class can simplify some things, e.g. the definition of launch configurations
    in an IDE. If the application supports command line arguments, a custom
    startup class is also required. For these reasons the tutorial application
    comes with its own startup class, but with a very simple one. It is derived
    from <code>Application</code> and just calls the corresponding method to get
    the framework running:
  </p>
    
<div class="source">
<pre>
package net.sf.jguiraffe.examples.tutorial;

import net.sf.jguiraffe.gui.app.Application;
import net.sf.jguiraffe.gui.app.ApplicationException;

public class Main extends Application
{
    /**
     * The main method of the application. Starts the whole application.
     * @param args command line arguments
     */
    public static void main(String[] args) throws ApplicationException
    {
        startup(new Main(), args);
    }
}
    </pre></div>
  
<p>
    You may wonder how the framework knows which main window to display. The
    startup class does not contain any information about this. The answer is
    that this information is obtained from the application's configuration.
    <i>JGUIraffe</i> uses <a class="externalLink" href="http://commons.apache.org/configuration">
    Apache Commons Configuration</a> to manage configuration data. So a
    configuration file compatible with this library has to be created. Actually,
    two configuration files are needed: One file is a description file listing
    several configuration sources. This file is named <i>config.xml</i> per
    default and is searched in the class path. The other file contains the
    actual configuration of the <i>JGUIraffe</i> framework; it is referenced
    from the first file. The <i>config.xml</i> file looks as follows for the
    tutorial application:
  </p>
    
<div class="source">
<pre>
&lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot; encoding=&quot;ISO-8859-1&quot;?&gt;

&lt;configuration&gt;
    &lt;system config-name=&quot;system-config&quot;/&gt;
	&lt;xml config-name=&quot;userConfig&quot; fileName=&quot;${user.home}/.jguiraffe-testappconfig.xml&quot;
      config-optional=&quot;true&quot; config-forceCreate=&quot;true&quot;/&gt;
	&lt;additional&gt;
		&lt;xml fileName=&quot;framework-config.xml&quot;/&gt;
	&lt;/additional&gt;
&lt;/configuration&gt;
    </pre></div>
  
<p>
    Here, in the section wrapped by the <code>&lt;additional&gt;</code> tags
    the actual configuration file for the framework - in this case named
    <i>framework-config.xml</i> - is defined. The other elements integrate
    some other configuration sources (which are useful, but not required for an
    application):
    </p>
<ul>
      
<li>The <code>&lt;system&gt;</code> element makes Java system properties
      available to the configuration system.</li>
      
<li>This is used by the following <code>&lt;xml&gt;</code> tag which defines
      an XML configuration file named <i>.jguiraffe-testappconfig.xml</i>
      located in the home directory of the current user. In this file data
      specific to a user can be stored; for instance, the framework stores here
      the position and the size of the main window, so on the next start of the
      application these properties can be restored.</li>
    </ul>
    The configuration of the framework is stored in the
    <i>framework-config.xml</i> file. Here also a minimum set of properties
    must be defined so that the framework knows what to do:
  
    
<div class="source">
<pre>
&lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot; encoding=&quot;ISO-8859-1&quot;?&gt;
&lt;config&gt;
  &lt;framework&gt;
    &lt;builder&gt;
      &lt;mainScript&gt;main.jelly&lt;/mainScript&gt;
      &lt;beandefinitions&gt;
        &lt;beandefinition&gt;tutorial-beans.jelly&lt;/beandefinition&gt;
      &lt;/beandefinitions&gt;
    &lt;/builder&gt;
    &lt;appctx&gt;
      &lt;defaultResourceGroup&gt;tutorial-resources&lt;/defaultResourceGroup&gt;
    &lt;/appctx&gt;

    &lt;storeuserconfig&gt;true&lt;/storeuserconfig&gt;
    &lt;userconfigname&gt;userConfig&lt;/userconfigname&gt;
  &lt;/framework&gt;
&lt;/config&gt;
    </pre></div>
  
<p>
    The most important piece of information is the name of the builder script
    defining the application's main window. It is defined by the
    <code>&lt;mainScript&gt;</code> element. The other elements configure some
    useful but optional functionality of the framework. We give a short overview
    over these elements:
    </p>
<ul>
      
<li>When starting an application an arbitrary number of files with bean
      definitions can be read. The beans defined in these files can then be
      queried from the application's global <code>BeanContext</code>. This is
      useful for instance for central services. For each bean definition file to
      be read a <code>&lt;beandefinition&gt;</code> element has to be added.</li>
      
<li>If an application uses localized strings, it can define the default
      resource group using the <code>&lt;defaultResourceGroup&gt;</code>
      element. The default resource group is used for each resource lookup if
      no specific group is provided.</li>
      
<li>The remaining elements define the so-called <i>user configuration</i>.
      This is the already mentioned configuration source in which user-specific
      data is stored. Here we specify that this mechanism should be enabled
      (<code>&lt;storeuserconfig&gt;true&lt;/storeuserconfig&gt;</code>) and
      which configuration source to use for this purpose. The name of the
      configuration source is passed to the <code>&lt;userconfigname&gt;</code>
      element and must match a configuration source which was defined in the
      main configuration description file <i>config.xml</i>.</li>
    </ul>
  
  
<p>
    This is basically all what is needed for a working <i>JGUIraffe</i>
    application. Well, of course, the main builder script referenced by the
    framework configuration file must also exist; this is highly specific to a
    concrete application.
  </p>
  
<p>
    Applications that use resources to translate texts will also ship with a set
    of resource properties files (provided that the default resource manager
    implementation is used which obtains resource texts from properties files).
    The tutorial application belongs to this group of applications. Its base
    resource bundle is named <i>tutorial-resources.properties</i>. (Note that
    the name matches the default resource group specified in the framework
    configuration. In the case of the default resource manager a resource group
    corresponds to a resource properties file. The properties file for the
    default language does not have an extension; the file with the German
    translations is named <i>tutorial-resources_de.properties</i>.)

<h3><a name="Packaging"></a>Packaging</h3>
  
<p>
    Before we start with the actual exploration of the tutorial application we
    will have to say some words about its package structure. There are multiple
    reasonable ways of packaging a UI application. For instance, classes could
    be grouped together in packages by their type. So you would end up with
    packages for model classes, controller classes, view classes, helper classes,
    etc. This is a valid packaging scheme, and it can be applied to
    <i>JGUIraffe</i> applications.
  </p>
  
<p>
    The tutorial application uses a different approach. It groups its classes by
    functionality. This means that there are packages related to the main UI
    elements (the main frame and the dialog windows) used by the application.
    (There is also a package with shared classes used by multiple windows.)
    This way of packaging is also suitable for <i>JGUIraffe</i> applications.
    The programming model of this framework typically leads to multiple small
    classes implementing specific functionality like event handling or task
    execution. View classes are not needed because views are defined in builder
    scripts. In many cases you do not even have a controller class because the
    default implementation of the framework is sufficient. So it makes sense to
    bundle the classes that implement logic for a specific window in a common
    package. By the way, these small and focused classes are much easier to
    unit test than large, monolitic view classes with lots of nested anonymous
    event listener classes.
  </p>
  </section>

  <section>
<h3><a name="The_main_frame"></a>The main frame</h3>
  
<p>
    The classes related to the application's main frame are all located in the
    <code>net.sf.jguiraffe.examples.tutorial.mainwnd</code> package. In addition
    to the main controller class, <code>MainWndController</code>, the package
    contains a bunch of helper classes, e.g. for processing events or for
    serving as model objects for UI elements. The frame window itself is
    constructed from the builder script <code>main.jelly</code> which can be
    found in the <code>src/main/resources</code> directory. (This is the maven
    default directory for non-Java files which have to be added to the generated
    jar. Here all builder scripts, configuration files and resource bundles are
    stored.)
  </p>
  
<p>
    <code>MainWndController</code> is responsible for most of the logic of the
    main frame window. This is different from typical controller implementations
    for dialog windows: a dialog window is mainly concerned with gathering data
    from the user and processing the results. The application's main frame
    window serves a different purpose. Therefore the controller class is very
    specific to the logic of the application. It is not associated with the
    frame in the usual way, and it does not extend the controller base class
    defined by the <i>JGUIraffe</i> framework (which is focused on dialog
    windows). The association between the controller object and the UI is done
    by the dependency injection framework. The controller is passed references
    to all UI elements it has to interact with. Analogously, all helper objects
    (e.g. event listeners) which have to call back the controller are passed a
    reference to it. The helper objects are very simple: they store a reference
    to the controller and call a corresponding method when they are triggered.
    Thus the view logic for handling the interaction between the UI elements can
    be implemented centrally in the <code>MainWndController</code> class.
  </p>
  
<p>
    The <code>main.jelly</code> builder script is a bit more complex than scripts
    defining dialog windows because it is also responsible for the application's
    main menu, its tool bar, and the actions representing menu items and/or
    tool bar buttons. These action declarations make up a large section in the
    builder script. Another big part defines the UI of the window: the combo
    box for the file system, the tree view with the directory tree, and the
    table with the current directory's content. The remaining parts define
    helper objects and plug them together.
  </p>
  
<p>
    <code>MainWndController</code> is notified when the selection of the combo
    box with the root file systems changes. This is done by the
    <code>FileSystemChangeListener</code> class. In response of this event the
    controller has to update the tree view so that it shows the content of the
    newly selected file system. As the tree view's model a
    <code>HierarchicalConfiguration</code> object from the
    <a class="externalLink" href="http://commons.apache.org/configuration">Apache Commons
    Configuration</a> library is used. A configuration node in this model object
    represents a node that is displayed by the tree view. The controller stores
    the configuration nodes associated with root file elements. So it can
    detect whether it already has loaded data for a file system or whether it
    has to load this data now. In any case the model of the tree view is
    manipulated so that it points to the data of the newly selected file system.
  </p>
  
<p>
    The controller also has to be notified about changes in the selection of
    the tree view. When the user navigates the tree the corresponding directory
    has to be displayed in the table. Because a whole file system can become
    pretty huge, the controller does not load it at once. Rather, only a single
    layer (a directory with its files and subdirectories) is loaded. If a
    directory is selected whose content has not yet been loaded, the controller
    executes a command of type <code>ReadDirectoryCommand</code> in the
    background. The command reads the content of the directory and performs the
    corresponding sort and filter operations. On completion of the command the
    model of the tree view is updated. The configuration nodes forming the tree's
    model are associated with objects of type <code>DirectoryData</code> from
    the <code>model</code> package. They contain the data required for the
    display of a directory. Such an object is determined during the processing
    of the selection changed event of the tree view - either it has already been
    present in the model or it has just been created by a
    <code>ReadDirectoryCommand</code>. It is then used to populate the table.
  </p>
  
<p>
    The data model of the table is a plain <code>java.util.ArrayList</code>. It
    is filled from the data of the <code>DirectoryData</code> object obtained
    from the tree view's model. Actually, the list contains objects of type
    <code>net.sf.jguiraffe.examples.tutorial.model.FileData</code>, a simple
    wrapper around a <code>java.io.File</code> object. The table is configured
    to display the single properties of such <code>FileData</code> objects.
    With the <code>FileSizeTransformer</code> class there is a special
    transformer implementation applied to the column with the file size: it
    displays the size in kilo bytes.
  </p>
  </section>

  <section>
<h3><a name="The_view_settings_dialog"></a>The view settings dialog</h3>
  
<p>
    The classes implementing the view settings dialog are located in the
    <code>net.sf.jguiraffe.examples.tutorial.viewset</code> package; the
    builder script defining the dialog window is named
    <i>viewsettings.jelly</i>. While the main frame demonstrates usage of some
    of the advanced UI elements like trees and tables, the view settings dialog
    contains various types of simple controls, e.g. radio buttons, checkboxes,
    or input elements for other data types like numbers or dates.
  </p>
  
<p>
    The view settings dialog is a typical dialog window whose purpose is to
    enter data. Therefore the base classes provided by the <i>JGUIraffe</i>
    library for forms and controllers can be used. Because the UI has some
    dynamic aspects, there is a custom controller implementation named
    <code>ViewSettingsFormController</code> derived from the base class
    <code>FormController</code>. This controller class has the task to control
    the enabled state of some input elements which depent on the state of other
    elements. This is achieved by registering the controller object as listener
    for change events at the checkbox elements defined in the UI (registration
    is performed in a declarative way by tags in the builder script). These
    checkboxes are connected to input elements; the input elements are only
    enabled if the checkbox is selected. Therefore, when a change event is
    received, the controller determines the affected checkbox from the event's
    properties and obtains its selection state. It then maps the name of the
    checkbox to a component group and sets the enabled state of this group
    accordingly. The UI has been defined in a way that there are component
    groups for the elements which depend on checkboxes. So it is easy to find
    the elements affected by a change of a checkbox and to manipulate their
    state.
  </p>
  
<p>
    When the user closes the view settings dialog by clicking the OK button a
    command of type <code>CreateViewSettingsCommand</code> is executed. It
    creates a file in the current directory and stores the settings the user has
    entered in the dialog window in it. To do this the command needs some data:
    </p>
<ul>
      
<li>The data model of the form - an object of type
      <code>ViewSettings</code> lives in the current bean context. It has been
      stored there by the command which opened the view settings dialog.
      <code>ViewSettings</code> is a pretty simple data class. It has methods
      for loading and storing instances using standard Java serialization
      facilities.</li>
      
<li>The current directory must be known because in this directory the
      <code>ViewSettings</code> instance has to be stored. It is obtained from
      the central <code>ApplicationContext</code> object. The application context
      allows access to so-called typed properties which are intended to be used
      for managing central data required by multiple parts of the application.
      The controller of the main window sets this property whenever the user
      selects a new directory in the tree view.</li>
    </ul>
    After the command has written the file with the view settings it executes
    the <i>Refresh</i> action. This basically simulates a click on the
    corresponding tool bar icon. It causes another <code>ReadDirectoryCommand</code>
    to be executed so that the content of the current directory is read again.
    The <code>ReadDirectoryCommand</code> class is able to interprete the view
    settings for the current directory and apply filters and sort order
    accordingly.

  <section>
<h3><a name="A_long-running_operation"></a>A long-running operation</h3>
  
<p>
    Applications sometimes have the requirement to execute a task which may take
    a while. In such cases it is good practice to give the user some feedback
    about what is going on. A good choice for this purpose is a dialog window
    with a progress indicator. If possible, a cancel button can be provided
    which allows the user to cancel the operation.
  </p>
  
<p>
    The tutorial application defines an action that simulates such a long-running
    task. The implementation demonstrates how standard means provided by
    <i>JGUIraffe</i> can be used to implement a dialog window for visual
    feedback. The corresponding classes can be found in the
    <code>net.sf.jguiraffe.examples.tutorial.bgtask</code> package, there is
    also builder script named <i>bgtask.jelly</i>.
  </p>
  
<p>
    The builder script is a little bit special because it defines two dialog
    windows at once. The main dialog window is directly opened when the user
    selects the action for the long-running task. It presents some options for
    the configuration of the task - mainly the user can specify the duration
    using a slider control. (<i>Note:</i> There is also a checkbox which
    controls whether visual feedback is enabled, but this is only for testing
    purposes. A real application should probably always provide feedback.
    Actually, disabling visual feedback is used to test the behavior of the
    application if it is to be terminated and there is still a background task
    running. You can try what happens then.)
  </p>
  
<p>
    When closing the configuration dialog with OK an instance of the
    <code>BgTaskCommand</code> class is executed. This object is passed some
    references to helper and data objects via dependency injection:

<li>The <code><a href="apidocs/net/sf/jguiraffe/gui/builder/utils/GUISynchronizer.html">
      GUISynchronizer</a></code> object is required for accessing UI elements
      from a different thread than the event dispatch thread. The command object
      is executed in a background thread, so it has to use the synchronizer when
      it needs to manipulate the UI.</li>
      
<li>A reference to the second dialog window defined by the builder script.
      This is the dialog for giving feedback about the progress of the
      operation.</li>
      
<li>The data model of the first dialog window. This is a bean storing the
      data entered by the user in the configuration dialog.</li>
      
<li>A reference to the progress bar control contained in the feedback
      dialog. The command object uses this reference to increase the progress
      indicator.</li>
    </ul>
  
  
<p>
    At the beginning of its <code>execute()</code> method the command class
    opens the dialog window for the feedback of the operation. Then it simulates
    a long-running operation. This is done in a loop which sleeps for one
    second until the duration specified by the user is reached. In each iteration
    the current progress rate is calculated, and the progress indicator is
    updated correspondingly. Because the command runs in a background thread
    the <code>GUISynchronizer</code> has to be used for this purpose.
  </p>
  
<p>
    After completion of the <code>execute()</code> method the
    <code>performGUIUpdate()</code> method is called automatically in the event
    dispatch thread. Here the feedback dialog window is closed.
  </p>
  
<p>
    The command class also implements the <code>FormActionListener</code>
    interface and is registered as action listener at the <i>Cancel</i>
    button of the feedback dialog (via an <code>&lt;a:eventListener&gt;</code>
    tag in the builder script). So it gets notified when the user wishes to
    cancel the operation. In this case the <i>Cancel</i> button is disabled -
    to show the user that the click was recognized -, and a flag is set which
    causes the main loop of the command to terminate.
  </p>
  
<p>
    What is only simulated by the <code>BgTaskCommand</code> class can be
    transferred to real world use cases. The handling of the dialog window for
    the feedback of the operation can be done in a similar way. Then the task
    to be performed has to be broken down into several steps so that the
    progress indicator can be updated in a meaningful way. Listening to a cancel
    button and terminating the operation on demand is probably desired in most
    cases, too.
  </p>
  
<p>
    Note that for this kind of operations the feedback dialog is an essential
    implementation element. It does not only show the progress of the operation
    but also blocks the UI (it is a modal dialog) and prevents the user to
    trigger further actions. This is desired because in many use cases the user
    should not be allowed to start multiple background tasks in parallel which
    may conflict with each other. In <i>JGUIraffe</i> applications it is per
    default not possible to start multiple background tasks at once anyway
    because the command queue is only associated with a single worker thread. So
    tasks are executed one by one in isolation. If an application really needs a
    task that should run in the background independent from all other tasks of
    the application, it has to start a separate thread manually.
