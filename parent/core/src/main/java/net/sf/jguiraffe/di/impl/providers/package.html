<p>
In the <code>providers</code> sub package different implementations of the
<code>BeanProvider</code> interface can be found.
</p>
<p>
The implementations in this package can be divided into two groups:
<ul>
<li>Simple providers are only responsible for creating new bean instances, which
can happen in a bunch of different ways (e.g. calling <code>Class.newInstance()</code>,
invoking a constructor, using a constant object).</li>
<li><em>Life-cycle providers</em> wrap a simple provider and add a certain
semantic to the create operation. So an implementation exists that calls its
simple provider only once and then caches the returned bean. This provider
de facto implements a <em>singleton</em>. Another implementation will create a
new bean instance for every transaction. These life-cycle providers also support
enhanced initialization (e.g. by invoking methods on the created beans).</li>
</ul>
