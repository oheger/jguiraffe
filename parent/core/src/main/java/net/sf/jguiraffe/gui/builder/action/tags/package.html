Here the tags for creating actions and related objects are defined. The tag
handler classes defined in this package support the creation of actions, menu
bars and items, and tool bar buttons.
</p>
<p>
It is also possible to register event listeners at components. This can be done
in two different ways:
<ul>
<li>The tag handler classes <code>ActionListenerTag</code>,
<code>ChangeListenerTag</code>, and <code>FocusListenerTag</code> allow mapping
an event generated by a GUI component to an action. This is convenient if the
actions are used by the application anyway. Using filter conditions the exact
event types that should trigger the action can be specified.</li>
<li>The <code>EventRegistrationTag</code> class supports the more traditional
approach of registering a plain event listener instance at a component. This
approach is not limited to standard event types, but works with specific events
supported by specialized <code>ComponentHandler</code> implementations, too.
