<p>
In this package interfaces for specialized component handlers can be found. 
</p>
<p>
The <code>ComponentHandler</code> interface defines some basic operations
common to all components. For complex components additional operations may be
available. This package contains extended handler interfaces for these
components. The interfaces defined here typically extend the
<code>ComponentHandler</code> interface and then add further operations specific
to the represented component type.
</p>
<p>
The <code>createXXXX()</code> methods of the <code>ComponentManager</code>
interface will return these extended interfaces for the components affected. So
an application can cast the handlers returned by the <code>ComponentManager</code>
to the types defined in this package and make use of the extended functionality.
