This package defines the part of the builder that deals with components.
</p>
<p>
The <code>components</code> package defines some classes and interfaces that
allow dealing with GUI components in a platform-independent manner. Many of these
classes are used internally by the <code>tags</code> sub package for creating,
initializing, and connecting concrete GUI widgets. Applications may also make
use of these classes. Especially the <code>ComponentBuilderData</code> class
can be useful: it allows direct access to all widgets created during a builder
operation.
