A package with classes for enabling or disabling other elements.
</p>
<p>
In the UI of an application there is often the need to enable or disable certain
elements depending on the state the application is in. For instance, some
actions may not always be available, but only when the application is in a
specific state. Or, when a long-running background process is active, parts of
the application must not be changed until the process ends.
</p>
<p>
With the <code>ElementEnabler</code> interface this package provides a generic
mechanism for changing the enabled state of UI elements. The package also
contains concrete implementations of the <code>ElementEnabler</code> that deal
with specific elements, like GUI components, actions, or windows. Other parts
of the framework make use of these classes for implementing automatic enabling
or disabling of elements, e.g. during the execution of an action.
</p>
<p>
With the <code>EnablerBuilder</code> there is also a mechanism for creating
<code>ElementEnabler</code> objects based on textual specifications. This is
especially useful in builder scripts defining an application's UI as it provides
a convenient way of defining <code>ElementEnabler</code> objects.
