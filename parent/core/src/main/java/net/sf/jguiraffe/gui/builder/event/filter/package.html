This package contains classes for filtering events.
</p>
<p>
When constructing a GUI using a <em>builder</em> it is possible to register
event listeners at the components created during the build. There are specific
tags for this purpose. These tags support filters for exactly specifying the
event types for which the listeners should be triggered.
</p>
<p>
This package contains the central <code>EventFilter</code> interface and a
number of concrete implementations. The implementations support filtering by the
event class and type. It is also possible to combine multiple simple filters
to a more complex filter expression.
