The main package for events and event listeners definitions.
</p>
<p>
The JGUIraffe library provides generic event types independent of specific GUI
toolkits. The following generic event types (and corresponding listeners) are
supported:
<ul>
<li>Action events: Events of this type are triggered, e.g. by command buttons
or menu items. They indicate that the user has issued a command.</li>
<li>Focus events are triggered when a control gains or loses the keyboard focus.
</li>
<li>Change events are a generic mechanism for indicating that a control was
somehow changed. This could mean, for instance, that a selection in a list or a
tree control was changed or that the user has entered text into a text field.
</li>
<li>Window events: They are related to windows, e.g. opening a window, closing
a window, or activating it.</li>
</ul>
For each event type a corresponding listener interface exists. The methods
provided by these interfaces are similar to those supported by typical GUI
toolkits.
</p>
<p>
In addition to the event classes and event listener interfaces this package
contains the <code>FormEventManager</code> class, which is the central component
for registering event listeners at GUI components. It provides methods for
adding listeners of all types either globally or at specific controls.
Alternatively special tags in builder scripts can be used for registering event
listeners.
