<p>
The <code>utils</code> package contains some classes and interfaces providing
some special functionality that cannot be associated with other parts of the
<em>builder</em> framework.
</p>
<p>
The interfaces in this package define a kind of cross-cutting functionality
needed by many other components within the <em>JGUIraffe</em> library, e.g.
synchronization with the event dispatch thread or the ability to display a
message box.
