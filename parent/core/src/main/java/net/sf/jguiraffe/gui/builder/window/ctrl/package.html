This package contains classes and interfaces for the implementation of <em>form
controllers</em>.
</p>
<p>
Dealing with a form is typically a tedious task. When the GUI is setup, a lot of
tasks have to be performed for correctly handling user input: the input fields
of the form have to be filled with their initial values, user input has to be
validated, fields containing invalid data have to be marked somehow, committing
the form is only allowed if all entered data is valid, and so on.
</p>
<p>
This package defines a form controller base class that addresses these problems.
In collaboration with a bunch of helper classes, a form controller is able to
manage the whole life cycle of a form:
<ul>
<li>When the form is opened, its fields are initialized using the values of the
associated form bean. The form bean serves as the model of the form. It can be
passed to the builder.</li>
<li>During editing of the form by the user, a <code>FormValidationTrigger</code>
determines when a validation has to be performed. This could for instance be any
time the user leaves an input field. Of course, if the user hits the OK button
to close the form, a validation will always be initiated.</li>
<li>A <code>FieldMarker</code> is responsible for changing the display properties
of an input field depending on its current validation status. A concrete
implementation could for instance paint the background of input fields containing
invalid data in a different color.</li>
<li>When the form is finally closed and all entered data is valid, the content
of the form has to be written back into its model. Then typically an
application-specific action has to be performed, e.g. to persist the changes in
a database or something like that.</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
The main <code>FormController</code> class is the central point for implementing
this functionality. In most cases, it should be possible to use this class out
of the box. Application-specific logic can be injected by specifying configuration
objects when the controller is created. Adaptations to the specific look and
feel of a concrete application can be achieved by providing different
implementations of the helper objects involved.
