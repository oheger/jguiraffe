This package contains some common abstractions for working with standard
dialogs.
</p>
<p>
    <em>JGUIraffe</em> allows an application to make use of some standard
    dialogs that are typically supported by UI platforms. The pattern used when
    dealing with these dialogs is as follows:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>There is a service interface specific to a standard dialog type.</li>
    <li>The service interface defines methods for displaying the associated
    dialog, possibly in different flavors.</li>
    <li>The interface methods expect a parameters object that allows a
    customization of the dialog.</li>
    <li>The parameters object also contains a callback to be triggered when the
    dialog is closed per OK. It can then process the result produced by the
    dialog.</li>
</ul>
