This package contains implementations for concrete <em>binding strategies</em>.
</p>
<p>
A <em>binding strategy</em> acts as a mediator between a <code>Form</code> object
and the data model used by an application. By separating the binding
implementation from the form the form can support multiple model
implementations, e.g. plain Java beans, map-based data transfer object, or SDO.
</p>
<p>
This package contains a few fundamental binding implementations. The most
important one is <code>BeanBindingStrategy</code> that uses Java beans.
