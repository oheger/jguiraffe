This package contains the platform-independent base classes and helper classes
for the layout managers provided by the <em>JGUIraffe</em> library.
</p>
<p>
The most important class in this package is <code>PercentLayoutBase</code>
which implements the basic functionality of the <em>percent layout</em> layout
manager. <em>Percent layout</em> organizes components in a tabular structure.
For each cell of the table properties like the initial size, the alignment, or
a weight factor can be defined. The weight factor controls how additional space
that becomes available if the user resizes the window is assigned to the cells
comprising the layout. The properties of a cell are specified by an instance of
<code>CellConstraints</code>.
</p>
<p>
The <code>PercentLayout</code> class is the platform-independent implementation
of <em>percent layout</em>. Based on the same concepts there are some other
platform-independent layout manager implementations:
<ul>
<li><code>BorderLayout</code> provides the same functionality as the AWT layout
manager with the same name with some slight enhancements.</li>
<li><code>ButtonLayout</code> is specialized on layouting the command buttons of
a dialog (e.g. a bar at the bottom of the dialog containing buttons like
<em>Save</em>, <em>Cancel</em>, or <em>Help</em>. All buttons have the same size
and space between them.</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
The term <em>platform-independent</em> in this context means that the layout
manager classes defined in this package implement the basic layouting
algorithms, but they do not adhere to special layout manager interfaces. Other
packages provide concrete sub classes of these classes that can be used in
specific GUI toolkits, e.g. Swing.
