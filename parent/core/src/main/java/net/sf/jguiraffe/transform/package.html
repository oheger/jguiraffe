The <em>transform</em> package contains interfaces and classes for transforming
and validating data.
</p>
<p>
Form processing always includes the validation of the data entered by the user.
If input is valid, it has to be copied into the application's data model. This
step may require the conversion of data into some other types to conform with
the types used within the model.
</p>
<p>
This package deals with both of these use cases. It defines the
<code>Transformer</code> interface for data conversion and the <code>Validator</code>
interface for validation. There are also fully functional implementations of
these interfaces for the most common use cases.
</p>
<p>
It is also possible to implement custom transformers and validators. The
interfaces are straight forward and easy to implement. When defining a form
using the <em>GUI builder</em> the transformers and validators to use can be
specified.
</p>
<p>
The <code>Form</code> class representing an input form in this framework
implements some functionality for processing data entered by the user. It first
invokes all registered validators on the input components. Only if this step was
successful, the transformers are invoked. This causes the data entered by the
user to be converted as necessary and copied into the bean associated with the
form.
</p>
<p>
If a validator finds out that an input field contains invalid data, it returns
a <code>ValidationResult</code> object with one or more error messages. Each
message consists of a key that is specific for this kind of error message and a
text to be displayed to the user. This text can contain further information
about the error and how to resolve it (e.g. something like &quot;This field must
contain a number less than 100&quot;; note that dynamic data depending on the
validator's configuration is automatically added). In the documentation of each
validator class the possible error messages are listed.
</p>
<p>
In addition to the key and the message a <code>ValidationResult</code> object
also contains a level. The default level is <code>ERROR</code> indicating the
input is actually invalid. It is also possible to use the level
<code>WARNING</code>, which means that the input will be accepted, but may cause
problems. Whether a validator produces error or warning messages can be
configured with properties in the <code>TransformerContext</code>. For more
information refer to the documentation of <code>DefaultValidationMessageHandler</code>.
</p>
<p>
Changing the error messages for certain or all validators is an often required
use case. Per default error messages are obtained from the resource manager:
the key of the error message is used as resource ID, as resource group the
reserved name &quot;validators&quot; is used. The framework is shipped with
default error messages in a couple of supported languages. If a specific language
you need is not supported, you can add your own bundle for this language. To
override specific validation error messages there are the following options:
</p>
<p>
<ul>
<li>When a validator is defined in a builder script (in the body of the
definition of the associated input component), properties can be set for this
validator. In addition to configuration properties that affect the behavior of
this validator, its error messages can also be defined. This can be done by
using the key of the error message (as defined in the documentation of this
validator) and assigning the new error text to it as the property's value. By
making use of the <code>&lt;localizedProperty&gt;</code> tag, the new error
message can be obtained from the application's resources. With this approach
the error message for a specific input field can be adapted.</li>
<li>To change a certain error message globally, another approach is better
suited: Internally error messages for validation errors are obtained from an
implementation of the <code>ValidationMessageHandler</code> interface. With
<code>DefaultValidationMessageHandler</code> the framework provides a default
implementation of this interface. The implementation to use is defined in the
application's bean definition, by a bean named &quot;validationMessageHandler&quot;.
This bean definition can be overridden by an application to modify properties
of the default message handler or even inject a completely different
implementation. <code>DefaultValidationMessageHandler</code> allows setting a
number of resource groups, in which it searches for the resources for error
messages. So you can create your own resource group for error messages, which
contains only resources for the error messages you want to change. If a message
cannot be resolved in one of these groups, the default group for error messages
is used. Refer to the documentation of <code>DefaultValidationMessageHandler</code>
for a full description of all supported properties. By providing your own
implementation of the <code>ValidationMessageHandler</code> interface you are
free to implement an arbitrary strategy for obtaining error messages.</li>
</ul>
