  <p>
    This module provides core functionality of the <em>JGUIraffe</em>
    library. It defines fundamental classes and interfaces, and implements
    the several supported builders for UI components.
  </p>
  <p>
    Typically, an application does not directly depend on this module. Rather,
    one of the specific UI platform integrations is used which pulls in a
    transitive dependency to this module.
