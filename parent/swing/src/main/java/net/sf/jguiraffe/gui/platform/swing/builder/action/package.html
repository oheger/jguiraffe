This package contains Swing-specific implementations for action-related classes.
</p>
<p>
The most important class is certainly <code>SwingActionManager</code>, which
provides a Swing-specific implementation of the <code>ActionManager</code>
interface. <code>SwingFormAction</code> implements the platform-neutral concept
of <code>FormAction</code>s based on the actions available in Swing. Finally
there is an implementation of the <code>PopupMenuBuilder</code> interface.
