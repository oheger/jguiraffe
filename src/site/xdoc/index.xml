  <section name="Welcome to JGUIraffe">
  <p>
    This is the official project site of the <em>JGUIraffe</em> library.
    <em>JGUIraffe</em> is a framework supporting the implementation of Java
    desktop applications using concepts like declarative UI definition,
    action and command objects, and dependency injection. On this page you find
    comprehensive documentation and download links. The documentation consists
    of the following parts:
    <ul>
      <li>
      The <em>JGUIraffe</em> reference documentation inlcuding a short
      <a href="introduction.html">introduction</a> or a
      <a href="userguide/user_guide.html">user's guide</a>. Aggregated
      <a href="apidocs/index.html">Javadocs</a> are available as well. Use the
      links on the left hand side menu to navigate to these documents. When
      learning the library this is the place to start.
      </li>
      <li>
      <a href="jguiraffe-parent/jguiraffe-examples/index.html">The JGUIraffe examples
      documentation</a> deals with the examples shipped with the library. This
      includes a description of the <em>JGUIraffe tutorial application</em> - an
      application which demonstrates many concepts of the library combined to a
      real world example.
      </li>
      <li>
      The <em>JGUIraffe</em> library consists of several sub modules. These can
      be accessed from the <em>Modules</em> menu. Here you find additional
      information specific to these modules like several types of development
      reports.
      </li>
    </ul>

  <subsection name="Downloads">
  <p>
    The <em>JGUIraffe</em> distributions are available in two different flavours:
    <ul>
      <li>The binary distribution mainly contains the jar with the code of the
      library. This is needed when running an application based on
      <em>JGUIraffe</em>. In addition, there are the Javadocs and helper jars
      with source code and API documentation which can be integrated into
      common IDEs.</li>
      <li>The source distribution contains the sources of the <em>JGUIraffe</em>
      library, the examples, and the web site. From these sources the library
      can be built using the <a href="building.html">Maven build</a>.</li>
    </ul>
  </p>
  <p>
    You can dowload both distributions from the
    <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/jguiraffe/">Sourceforge project
    site.</a>. To ensure integrity the artifacts have been signed. Please make
    sure that you verify the signature after downloading. A file with the keys
    used for signing can be found
    <a href="https://jguiraffe.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/jguiraffe/trunk/conf/KEYS">
    here</a>.
