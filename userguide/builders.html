<h2><a name="Introducing_builders"></a>Introducing builders</h2>
  
<p>
    In the previous sections some of the key concepts of the <i>JGUIraffe</i>
    library have been described. Allthough there have been some code examples,
    there has not yet been a complete example that constructs a full user
    interface and combines the elements discussed so far. The reason for this is
    that the single elements of a <i>JGUIraffe</i> application are typically
    not created by hand. Rather, this is the task of so-called <i>builders</i>.
  </p>
  
<p>
    The <i>JGUIraffe</i> library uses the term <i>builder</i> for a
    component that is capable of interpreting a <i>builder script</i> and
    producing objects from it. The results of such a builder operation can be
    graphical components which are part of the user interface. They can also be
    plain old Java objects (POJOs) implementing business logic.
  </p>
  
<p>
    For instance, if an application wants to display a dialog box, there is no
    code that creates the dialog window, initializes the graphical components,
    associates them with a <code>Form</code> object, and so on. Instead the
    application has a builder script that contains all relevant definitions.
    This script is passed to the builder. When the builder completes the fully
    initialized dialog window with all its helper objects is available and can
    be displayed.
  </p>
  
<p>
    In this section we give a high-level overview over builders and how they are
    used to bring the concepts discussed so far together to form a fully
    functional application. Subsequent sections will then deal with specific
    builder types and provide detailed information about constructing different
    kinds of elements.
  </p>

  <section>
<h3><a name="Why_builders"></a>Why builders</h3>
  
<p>
    If you have ever implemented a user interface - e.g. a Swing UI - directly
    in Java, you will certainly agree that the resulting Java code can be, well,
    problematic. It is hard to read as it is not obvious which parts of the code
    are responsible for which parts of the UI. And it is even harder to maintain
    or to incorporate changes of the user interface. Therefore the authors of
    this library belief that there should be a separation between Java code and
    the definition of the user interface. This can lead to the following
    advantages:
    </p>
<ul>
    
<li>A declarative style for defining the UI can be used. This can be much
    more readable than Java code because it is free of boiler-plate code and
    focuses on a very specific use case.</li>
    
<li>The format for defining the UI can resemble the hierarchical structure
    of the components that form the user interface. Thus it is easier to see
    which parts of the definition correspond to which parts of the user
    interface. This makes changes of the user interface easier.</li>
    
<li>Changes at the UI can be performed without having to recompile the
    application. It is even possible to create UI definitions dynamically and
    interprete them at runtime.</li>
    
<li>A declarative syntax does not hard-wire UI elements to specific Java
    classes. This is an additional layer of abstraction which can be used to
    create different UIs from a single definition - depending on the
    configuration or type of the builder used.</li>
    
<li>This approach can also lead to a cleaner overall programming model.
    Naive UI programming often makes use of many anonymous inner classes defined
    in window or other UI classes acting as event listeners. If there is a
    well-defined interface between the user interface definition and controller
    logic, there is no need to create lots of inner classes, and business logic
    can be much more centralized.</li>
    </ul>
  
  
<p>
    In the first line builders make the construction of a user interface element
    like a dialog box very convenient and reduce the amount of Java code
    required for this purpose significantly. They also ensure that all the
    helper components provided by the <i>JGUIraffe</i> library to simplify UI
    programming are correctly created, initialized, and wired together. For
    instance, when a window for a dialog box is constructed, the builder
    automatically creates a corresponding
    <code><a href="../apidocs/net/sf/jguiraffe/gui/forms/Form.html">Form</a></code>
    object which can be used to read or write the contents of the graphical input
    components. A controller object for the dialog box can be created, too.
  </p>
  
<p>
    So builders link the different parts of a <i>JGUIraffe</i> application
    together. The result of a builder operation can be used directly by an
    application without additional initialization or configuration.
  </p>
  </section>

  <section>
<h3><a name="Builder_scripts"></a>Builder scripts</h3>
  
<p>
    A <i>builder script</i> contains definitions for the objects (graphical
    components or POJOs) to create. The default builder implementation in
    <i>JGUIraffe</i> is based on the
    <a class="externalLink" href="http://commons.apache.org/jelly">Apache Commons Jelly project</a>.
    This means that builder scripts are actual Jelly scripts, i.e. XML
    documents.
  </p>
  
<p>
    Jelly provides a powerful and flexible way of processing XML documents. The
    basic idea is that XML elements are mapped to Java classes - so-called
    <i>tag handler classes</i>. The Jelly engine processes the XML document,
    inspects the single XML elements, creates the corresponding tag handler
    objects and invokes them. This basically means that the XML document is
    executed as if it was a program written in a specialized XML-based
    programming language.
  </p>
  
<p>
    Jelly ships with many standard tag handler classes organized in different
    <i>tag libraries</i>. A tag library contains several related tag handler
    classes and associates them with an XML namespace. (The XML elements in a
    Jelly script are all prefixed with a namespace indicating the tag library
    they belong to. This makes it possible to have tags with identical names in
    different tag libraries.) There are tag libraries defining core programming
    constructs (like conditional execution, loops, or including other scripts)
    and other, very specialized tag libraries as well. The latter include tag
    libraries for XML processing, thread handling, accessing HTML pages,
    sending e-mails, and many more. All these standard tag libraries can be
    used in builder scripts.
  </p>
  
<p>
    Writing a custom Jelly tag handler class is not complicated. The class can
    extend the base class <code>org.apache.commons.jelly.TagSupport</code>. Then
    it has to define the <code>doTag()</code> method. Here arbitrary logic of
    the tag can be implemented.
  </p>
  
<p>
    The <i>JGUIraffe</i> library contains some custom tag libraries that deal
    with the creation of several objects. The following table lists these
    specific tag libraries and provides a short description for each. They are
    discussed in detail in later sections.

<p>
    This script defines a simple dialog window with a text field for entering a
    file name and a text area for the file content. The
    <a href="layouts.html">PercentLayout manager</a> is used for laying out the
    components. The dialog also has two buttons for creating the file or for
    canceling the operation.
  </p>
  
<p>
    Real-world builder scripts tend to be a bit larger because typically some
    helper objects (e.g. controllers, actions, validators, etc.) are defined,
    too. This is actually one disadvantage of this approach: builder scripts can
    become pretty verbose. Jelly provides some means for addressing this problem.
    For instance, it is possible to devide the functionality in multiple sub
    scripts which are then included in the main script.

<h3><a name="Builder_interfaces"></a>Builder interfaces</h3>
  
<p>
    Access to a builder is possible through the
    <code><a href="../apidocs/net/sf/jguiraffe/gui/builder/Builder.html">Builder
    </a></code> interface. This interface defines the following methods for
    creating objects:
    </p>
<ul>
    
<li><code>build()</code> is a generic builder method. It processes a builder
    script that may define arbitrary objects. Access to the objects created by
    the builder is possible through the data objects passed to the method (see
    below).</li>
    
<li><code>buildContainer()</code> can be used for constructing a UI if the
    root container (e.g. a panel) is already available. The root container is
    passed to the builder. Graphical components defined in the builder script
    are then added to this container.</li>
    
<li><code>buildWindow()</code> is a convenience method for creating a
    complete window. The method expects that the builder script to be processed
    defines a kind of window. This window is returned.</li>
    </ul>
    <code>buildContainer()</code> and <code>buildWindow()</code> are merely
    convenience methods which can be implemented in terms of the generic
    <code>build()</code> method. In addition to these methods there is a
    <code>release()</code> method which can be used to free all resources
    obtained by objects created by the script. Usually the developer does not
    have to call this method explicitly because this is done by the framework.
  
  
<p>
    A builder needs a lot of parameters to fulfill its task. When invoking the
    builder these parameters have to be passed in form of a
    <code><a href="../apidocs/net/sf/jguiraffe/gui/builder/BuilderData.html">
    BuilderData</a></code> object. The <code>BuilderData</code> object is pretty
    complex. It does not only define input parameters for the builder but also
    allows access to the builder results. Fortunately the major part of the
    input parameters can be inferred from global application data. Therefore it
    is not necessary to create and populate a <code>BuilderData</code> object by
    hand. Rather, there is a convenience method in the
    <code><a href="../apidocs/net/sf/jguiraffe/gui/app/ApplicationContext.html">
    ApplicationContext</a></code> class that returns an initialized object. We
    will show this later in an example.
  </p>
  
<p>
    Another important information required by the builder is of course the
    script to be processed. Typically these scripts are located in the file
    system or in the class path of the application. <i>JGUIraffe</i>
    provides an abstraction for the concrete location of a builder script in
    form of the
    <code><a href="../apidocs/net/sf/jguiraffe/locators/Locator.html">
    Locator</a></code> interface. There are multiple concrete
    <code>Locator</code> implementations, including a locator for files, for
    URLs, or for scripts in the application's class path. Another interesting
    <code>Locator</code> implementation is
    <code><a href="../apidocs/net/sf/jguiraffe/locators/ByteArrayLocator.html">
    ByteArrayLocator</a></code>. This class allows passing a script to a builder
    that was created in memory, e.g. as a string.
  </p>
  
<p>
    These are the most important interfaces related to builders. There are a
    couple of other interfaces involved. These are discussed in the details
    section.
  </p>
  </section>

  <section>
<h3><a name="Invoking_a_builder"></a>Invoking a builder</h3>
  
<p>
    To invoke a builder in order to execute a builder script the following steps
    have to be performed:
    </p>
<ul>
    
<li>A reference to the
    <code><a href="../apidocs/net/sf/jguiraffe/gui/builder/Builder.html">Builder
    </a></code> object has to be obtained.</li>
    
<li>The
    <code><a href="../apidocs/net/sf/jguiraffe/gui/builder/BuilderData.html">
    BuilderData</a></code> object required by the builder has to be created and
    initialized..</li>
    
<li>A <code><a href="../apidocs/net/sf/jguiraffe/locators/Locator.html">
    Locator</a></code> object pointing to the builder script has to be created.</li>
    
<li>The appropriate <code>build()</code> method of the builder has to be
    called.</li>
    </ul>
  
  
<p>
    All these steps can be done manually. For instance, the various parameters
    managed by a <code>BuilderData</code> object could be set by hand.
    Fortunately, this is not necessary because
    <code><a href="../apidocs/net/sf/jguiraffe/gui/app/ApplicationContext.html">
    ApplicationContext</a></code> provides methods that do the major part of the
    work already. So just a few lines of code are needed as shown in the
    following code fragment:
  </p>
    
<div class="source">
<pre>
Builder builder = application.getApplicationContext().newBuilder();
ApplicationBuilderData builderData = application
        .getApplicationContext().initBuilderData();

Locator locator = ClassPathLocator.getInstance(&quot;mywindow.jelly&quot;);
Window window = builder.buildWindow(locator, builderData);
    </pre></div>
  
<p>
    In this example <code>application</code> refers to the global
    <code>Application</code> object. First a new <code>Builder</code> object is
    obtained using the <code>newBuilder()</code> method of the application
    context. Then the <code>initBuilderData()</code> method of
    <code>ApplicationContext</code> returns an initialized object of the
    <code><a href="../apidocs/net/sf/jguiraffe/gui/app/ApplicationBuilderData.html">
    ApplicationBuilderData</a></code> class which is a default implementation of
    the <code>BuilderData</code> interface. The object returned by
    <code>initBuilderData()</code> contains already all information required by
    the builder. So it can be used directly. Alternatively it is possible to set
    further properties or change some of the default settings before the builder
    is actually invoked.
  </p>
  
<p>
    Next a <code>Locator</code> object is created pointing to the builder script.
    In this case a script named <i>mywindow.jelly</i> is to be executed which
    is located in the application's class path. If the application is packaged
    in a jar archive, the script is probably also part of this jar. The
    <code><a href="../apidocs/net/sf/jguiraffe/locators/ClassPathLocator.html">
    ClassPathLocator</a></code> class searches the whole class path for a
    resource with the specified name.
  </p>
  
<p>
    Now all information required for executing the builder script is available.
    In the last line the builder is called. Here the <code>buildWindow()</code>
    method is called which returns the main window defined in the builder
    script. (We assume that the script named <i>mywindow.jelly</i> actually
    defines a window.) The window returned by the builder can now be used. If
    something goes wrong - for instance, if the script cannot be found or
    contains invalid instructions -, a
    <code><a href="../apidocs/net/sf/jguiraffe/gui/builder/BuilderException.html">
    BuilderException</a></code> is thrown.
  </p>
  
<p>
    For creating and opening a window - e.g. a dialog box - there is an even
    more convenient way. Because this is a use case needed frequently by a
    typical application the <i>JGUIraffe</i> library provides a convenience
    class which does exactly the steps outlined above:
    <code><a href="../apidocs/net/sf/jguiraffe/gui/app/OpenWindowCommand.html">
    OpenWindowCommand</a></code>.
  </p>
  
<p>
    As the name implies, <code>OpenWindowCommand</code> is a
    <a href="commands.html">command object</a>. Therefore it can be executed in
    a background thread. (Executing a builder script should normally be very
    fast. However, it does not hurt to do this in a background thread.) When an
    instance is created the <code>Locator</code> object defining the builder
    script must be provided. Then the command can be executed, and the newly
    created window is displayed automatically.
