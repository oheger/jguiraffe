<h2><a name="Commands"></a>Commands</h2>
  
<p>
    Popular UI libraries like Swing or SWT are not thread-safe. They use a
    specialized thread, the so-called <i>event dispatch thread</i> that is
    the only instance which is allowed to interact with UI components. This
    thread also processes all user input. Because the <i>JGUIraffe</i> library
    is implemented on top of these libraries similar restrictions apply.
  </p>
  
<p>
    Naive UI programming often uses event listeners that are registered at UI
    components like buttons or menu items and implement the corresponding
    functionality. This approach is problematic for multiple reasons:
    </p>
<ul>
    
<li>Java makes it convenient to implement event listeners as anonymous
    inner classes defined directly in the code that constructs the UI. This
    causes the business logic to be located next to UI code and leads to code
    that is hardly maintainable.</li>
    
<li>All event listeners are invoked in the <i>event dispatch thread</i>.
    If processing of an event takes a while, the thread is blocked and cannot
    update the UI any more. Thus the user gets the impression that the
    application hangs.</li>
    
<li>There is no standard way of accessing central data required by event
    listeners. Each application has to invent its own solution. Often all needed
    data is kept in member fields of the main window class because from here it
    can easily be accessed by anonymous event listener classes.</li>
    </ul>
  
  
<p>
    The <i>JGUIraffe</i> library supports a different programming model. Here
    logic is implemented in so-called <i>command objects</i>.
  </p>

  
<div class="section">
<h3><a name="The_concept_of_commands"></a>The concept of commands</h3>
  
<p>
    <i>Command objects</i> are an application of the <i>command pattern</i>
    described by Gamma et al. They are implemented by classes that adhere to a
    specific interface. When the user interacts with the application command
    objects are created and passed to the central
    <tt><a href="../apidocs/net/sf/jguiraffe/gui/app/Application.html">
    Application</a></tt> object to be executed. <tt>Application</tt>
    maintains a single worker thread that executes the commands passed to it
    one after another. After their execution in the worker thread commands get
    the chance to update the UI in order to display the results of their
    execution. This is automatically synchronized with the special <i>event
    dispatch thread</i>.
  </p>
  
<p>
    So the concept of commands is pretty simple. Nevertheless it has a number of
    advantages:
    </p>
<ul>
    
<li>Logic is executed in a separate worker thread. Therefore the UI stays
    responsive because the event dispatch thread is not blocked.</li>
    
<li>The programmer does not have to deal with thread creation or management
    as this is handled transparently by the framework.</li>
    
<li>Because commands are executed by a single worker thread many
    synchronization tasks are simplified. For instance, two command objects
    cannot conflict with each other because they are executed in isolation.</li>
    
<li>Command objects provide a pretty stringent programming model: They
    conform to object-oriented design principles. For instance, all data required
    by a command can be stored in member fields of the command class; it can be
    automatically injected before the command is executed. That way the logic
    implemented by an application can be centralized much better and becomes
    easier to maintain.</li>
    </ul>
    We will now have a deeper look over the interface of a command object.
  
  </div>

  
<div class="section">
<h3><a name="Fundamental_interfaces_and_classes"></a>Fundamental interfaces and classes</h3>
  
<p>
    The <i>JGUIraffe</i> library defines an interface for command objects:
    <tt><a href="../apidocs/net/sf/jguiraffe/gui/cmd/Command.html">
    Command</a></tt>. This interface defines the following methods:
    </p>
<ul>
    
<li><tt>execute()</tt> is the main execution method of the command. This
    method is invoked in a background thread. It contains the main execution
    logic of the command, however, from this method no GUI updates are allowed.
    <tt>execute()</tt> does not expect any parameters, but it can throw an
    exception.</li>
    
<li>Exceptions thrown by the <tt>execute()</tt> method are caught by
    the executing task. If an exception is detected, the <tt>onException()</tt>
    method of the command object is invoked (also in the background thread). So
    this is the place for error handling logic.</li>
    
<li><tt>onFinally()</tt> is the last method invoked on the background
    thread. As the name implies, this method is always invoked - whether an
    exception was thrown or not. An implementation may for instance free
    resources used by the command.</li>
    
<li>After background processing ends the command object gets the chance to
    update the UI. For this purpose the <tt>Command</tt> interface defines
    the <tt>getGUIUpdater()</tt> method. <tt>getGUIUpdater()</tt> can
    return a <tt>Runnable</tt> object, which is then executed in the event
    dispatch thread. Therefore it can access all UI components and perform
    arbitrary updates.</li>
    </ul>
  
  
<p>
    As can be seen, the <tt>Command</tt> interface is slightly more complex.
    There is not only a single <tt>execute()</tt> method, but the interface
    contains also methods for handling exceptions. To simplify the
    implementation of custom command classes the library provides an abstract
    base class for commands:
    <tt><a href="../apidocs/net/sf/jguiraffe/gui/cmd/CommandBase.html">
    CommandBase</a></tt>. <tt>CommandBase</tt> provides an implementation
    of <tt>onException()</tt> that simply logs the exception and stores it
    in a member field. (It can be queried using the <tt>getException()</tt>
    method.) There is also an empty default implementation of the
    <tt>onFinally()</tt> method. Concrete sub classes mainly have to
    define the <tt>execute()</tt> method to implement the actual logic.
  </p>
  
<p>
    <tt>CommandBase</tt> also supports UI updates. It provides the
    protected <tt>performGUIUpdate()</tt> method in which code that needs
    to access the UI can be placed. The base class ensures that this method is
    automatically called in the event dispatch thread after execution of the
    command. Whether UI updates should actually be performed can be specified
    when a <tt>CommandBase</tt> object is created: The constructor can be
    passed a boolean flag which determines whether the
    <tt>performGUIUpdate()</tt> should be called. Commands that do not need
    UI updates should call the super constructor with the parameter <b>false</b>,
    then this method is skipped.
  </p>
  </div>

  
<div class="section">
<h3><a name="An_example_command"></a>An example command</h3>
  
<p>
    Now that we have introduced the API of command objects let's implement an
    example command. The command should read the content of a directory and
    update the model of a table component to display this data. (Because table
    components have not been discussed so far, we have to give some notes to
    make the example understandable: A table can be accessed through the
    <tt>TableHandler</tt> interface. This interface provides access to the
    table's model which is simply a list with data objects. To update the
    table's content we can fill new data objects into this list and then notify
    the table that its model has changed. For this example we put the
    <tt>java.io.File</tt> objects directly into the table model and assume
    that the table was configured to display their properties.)
  </p>
  
<p>
    Our command class extends <tt>CommandBase</tt>, the abstract base class
    for command objects. It needs some parameters to fulfill its task which are
    passed to the constructor:
    </p>
<ul>
    
<li>A <tt>java.io.File</tt> object for the directory to be read.</li>
    
<li>The <tt>TableHandler</tt> reference representing the table to be
    filled.</li>
    </ul>
    The following code fragment shows the class declaration and the constructor:
  
    
<div class="source">
<pre>
public class ReadDirectoryCommand extends CommandBase
{
    /** The directory to be read. */
    private final File directory;

    /** The table handler. */
    private final TableHandler tableHandler;

    /** The list with the files read. */
    private List&lt;File&gt; files;

    public ReadDirectoryCommand(File dir, TableHandler handler)
    {
        directory = dir;
        tableHandler = handler;
    }
    </pre></div>
  
<p>
    This code simply stores the arguments passed to the constructor in member
    fields. The class also defines a list field for the files found in the
    current directory. This field is filled by the <tt>execute()</tt>
    method which is shown in the following fragment:
  </p>
    
<div class="source">
<pre>
    @Override
    public void execute() throws Exception
    {
        files = new ArrayList&lt;File&gt;();

        // add the content of the directory to the list
        files.addAll(Arrays.asList(directory.listFiles()));

        // do some further manipulations, e.g. sort the list or apply a filter
    }
    </pre></div>
  
<p>
    After <tt>execute()</tt> terminates the data managed by this command is
    stored in the <tt>files</tt> list. For this example command we do not
    implement any exception handling logic. Thus we can live with the default
    implementations of <tt>onException()</tt> and <tt>onFinally()</tt>.
    However, the command needs to update the GUI. This is done in the
    <tt>performGUIUpdate()</tt> method which is automatically called after
    background execution is complete. In our implementation we have to add the
    files read by <tt>execute()</tt> to the model of the table. This can
    look as follows:
  </p>
    
<div class="source">
<pre>
    @Override
    protected void performGUIUpdate()
    {
        List&lt;Object&gt; model = tableHander.getModel();
        // first clear the model
        model.clear();

        // Now add the new files
        for (File f : files)
        {
            model.add(f);
        }

        // Notify the table about the change of its model
        tableHandler.tableDataChanged();
    }
    </pre></div>
  
<p>
    So far the complete implementation of the command class. Executing this
    command is easy: A new instance has to be created and passed to the
    <tt>execute()</tt> method of the central
    <tt><a href="../apidocs/net/sf/jguiraffe/gui/app/Application.html">
    Application</a></tt> object. If done by hand, this could look as follows:
  </p>
    
<div class="source">
<pre>
File dirToRead = ...;
TableHandler table = ...;
ReadDirectoryCommand cmd = new ReadDirectoryCommand(dirToRead, table);
application.execute(cmd);
    </pre></div>
  
<p>
    Note: Typically the developer does not have to care about the creation and
    execution of command objects. Rather, this is done behind the scenes by the
    framework in reaction of user actions. We discuss this later in this guide.
